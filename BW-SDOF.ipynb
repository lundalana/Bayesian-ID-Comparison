    "# Bouc-Wen Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this case study is to compare various model calibration methods on a simulated system displaying either simple linear or complex nonlinear behavior. We select a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator with a Bouc-Wen switch component BW-SDOF as our representative system. The basis for this example is derived from a case study by Wu & Smyth<sup>1</sup>, where the authors compared the performance of the unscented and extended Kalman filters on a single-degree-of-freedom Bouc-Wen system. We use the same parameters as given in this example and add a switch component between the linear and nonlinear displacement restoring forces of the system. The system model is visualized below.\n",
